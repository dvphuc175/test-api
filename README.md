# About
This project is a simple API built with Node.js and Express.js. This API provides basic user management functions, including:

- Fetch the list of users
- Filter users by name through query parameters
- View detail information about a user via their ID
- Add new users
- Update a user's name
- Delete a user

Currently, this API uses an array to store data, which is only for testing purposes. In reality, a database would be used to store and retrieve the data.
# Run projext
`npm start`
- Access localhost on your browser to check (only supports the GET method).
- Use Postman to test the other methods.
